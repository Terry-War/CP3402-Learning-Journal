For each week, complete an entry in your journal that includes at least the following sections (headings):

Week
Learning Activities & Resources
Estimated Hours
Content Insights
Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Here are some guidelines:

Your "Estimated Hours" section should be a simple, honest estimate of the number of hours you spent LEARNING. You don't need to explain in prose, just provide a time.
This is a "learning journal" not just a record of all the things you did in the subject. So, if you spent 3 hours fixing an error or designing a site, you don't put that here. But if while fixing the error, you decided to learn more about the issue through training, then that goes in your learning journal.
The "Learning Activities" section is not a general catch-all for things you did, it is only for recording explicit learning activities. Things like doing the prac, solving a problem, making a site... are NOT to go here. Watching a learning course, doing a tutorial, getting expert advice, going to a seminar... are all activities with the explicit purpose of learning; these go here.
Think of this as a useful resource for yourself. If you find a good learning resource, include the link so that weeks later, you can look back in your journal and find it easily again.
The first few sections can be brief, but the last two sections require you to reflect, think and write clearly what your insights were. Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks.
Let's be real. Sometimes you don't get any real "insights". Don't make up stuff (lies) to make it look like you've completed the work. Do you think that's what your company will want?
Examples of fairly poor (low marks) insights might be:

(Content) I revised HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
(Career/Employability/Learning) Lots of videos was boring.

Examples of good (high marks) insight might be:

(Content) I re-learned that HTML is used for site function/content and CSS is used for form/style. Separation of form and function is important for things like maintainability and device-dependent presentation.
(Career/Employability/Learning) I found watching lots of videos bored me quickly. Changing to watching videos for a short time, then practising what I'd just learned kept me much more engaged and I didn't have to keep re-watching videos because I'd drifted off.

Here are some examples of good journal entries from past students:

Example A
Learning Activities & Resources
This week I setup a child theme based off the WordPress Twenty Twenty theme, and studied some of the LinkedIn Learning courses after finishing the practical to ensure that I learned everything that I needed to know about child themes, which I think may be useful for the group assignment.

Estimated Hours
I spent about 4 hours of my own time this week on this subject, not including time I spent on the assignment.

Content Insights
Child themes were a good introduction to theme creation for WordPress, as it helped me understand the basics without jumping right into making my own theme from nothing. It was also a small step into PHP, which I'm feeling a bit more confident about after this week. I learned that variables are created with a $ in PHP, and that overall the language is somewhat similar to Java in general (which I have some decent experience with).

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I started to look at the LinkedIn Learning course on child themes to see if they gave any more insight that I did not obtain from the work I did in the practical. I did learn some things that I would not have learned otherwise, such as some of the more advanced CSS I did not learn in Web Design, which I think could be very useful in creating more minute detail in my websites in the future. From this strategy to learning this week, I have concluded that this approach to learning could be effective, but looking at guides, then doing some of the work, then going back to tutorials works better for me, as I discussed in an earlier week.

Example B
Learning Activities & Resources
Watching linked-in learning videos.

Content Insights
Child themes allow for the editing of existing themes without needing modify the main Theme. This allows for customization, without the worry of permanently editing the original design.
A child theme also allow for the edits to be saved and not be affected by updates to the theme.
If changes had be made to the original theme, then when an update comes out for the theme, these changes can be overwritten and lost.
However if a child theme was used instead, when these updates come out the changes can still be applied to the theme as they run off a separate file and the user doesn't have to worry about the changes they created being removed or needing to choose whether or not to update a theme or not.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Child themes are actively used by website designers to be able to make edits to sites, without needing to worry about changing the complete design of the template.
I understand using child themes make styling more efficient and able to make changes and not worry about them being removed.
However as they as for a specific area of development I don't know if I would be using them in the future as This is not an area I am looking at pursuing for my career.
It was interesting learning about what back end developers go through to create the work they do, But it all depends on where my career goes in the future, as to if I am using child themes in the future.
