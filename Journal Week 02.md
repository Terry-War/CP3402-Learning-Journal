# Week 02 - Learning Journal
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week was about setting up a Joomla based website, there was a issue with the Joomla site itself for hosting so had to use a alternitive via cloudaccess. This took longer then expected but all worked out in the end.

Everything for Joomla is new to me and had to learn from a number of sources, mainly Youtube.  

Joomla website = https://tezzas-tech.cloudaccess.host/  
Youtube video about how to use Joomla = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzdrt3BI0l8&t=932s 

## Estimated Hours 
3-4 hours.

## Content Insights
Joomla is a mess of a system that requires alot of back tracking when using articles or modules, etc. The idea is cool but I feel the implemtation is somewhat limited.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

### Career insights
 By having the knowlegde of Joomla and other CMS content such as hosting a custom website should help me with any upcoming career I choose to pursue. If i'm being honest I will not be pursuing a career that focus's on CMS or Joomla.

### Employability insights
If a company uses Joomla as its base code for CMS I am handing in my resignation on the spot.

### Learning insights
Joomla may be a system that seems simple on paper, but in practice it is anything but. I feel like the entire system is fighting you the entire time you are trying to add or edit anything.
