Content Insights
Bootstrap is a very useful website content sharing site/system that allows anyone to import a ready made template that can be tweaked to the user liking. Github pages allows users to create and host website from content available on github.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I Had to reinstall VS studio and remember how to write HTML code from 3 years ago. This caused a bit of a headache for awhile. But with the power of Google and older uni work I could fall back on to look over I figured out how to create a basic dummy site, then import a bootstrap template. The hardest part was figuring out Github pages. At first it didn't like the file structure I had created. Once the index.html was in the first file with the assets in its own file everything just worked.

Once the initial content was uploaded I had to remember how to create links between .html pages. The lucky thing was that the template I had chosen had half of the code required and I could just fill in the blanks. Cloned the initial github content and pushed and commited the completed static site.
