## Learning Activities & Resources
Held group interviews with the majority of the Townsville class. Learned some interesting facts about other classmates and their skills, experience, and work styles. This helped identify who may be suitable group members for future assessments.
Also deployed the WordPress version of my Joomla site. This involved importing a template, configuring pages, and testing the layout and usability.

## Estimated Hours
2-3 hours

## Content Insights
The interview process showed who would be a good group member based on communication, technical ability, and reliability.
The WordPress site was comparatively easier than using Joomla, especially in terms of template installation and customization. However, I had an issue with the footer in the template, as it appeared to be locked or controlled by the template settings, and I was unable to modify it easily. This showed that templates can sometimes limit customization unless you can edit theme files or settings.
